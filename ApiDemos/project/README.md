Google Maps Android API Demos
===================================

These are demos for the [Maps SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/)
and [Maps SDK for Android V3 BETA](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/v3-client-migration) libraries
in the Java programming language.

They demonstrate most of the features available in the API.

The Maps SDK for Android samples can be found under the `main` gradle product
flavor, while the Maps SDK V3 BETA samples can be found under the `v3` gradle
product flavor. The active product flavor can be modified through
Android Studio’s “Build Variants” toolbar options.
