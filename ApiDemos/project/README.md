Google Maps Android API Demos
===================================

These are demos for the [Maps SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk) in Java and Kotlin programming languages.

They demonstrate most of the features available in the API.

The Maps SDK for Android samples can be found under the `main` gradle product
flavor, while the Maps SDK V3 BETA samples can be found under the `v3` gradle
product flavor. The active product flavor can be modified through
Android Studio’s “Build Variants” toolbar options.
