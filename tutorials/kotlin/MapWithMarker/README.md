Prerequisites
--------------

- Android API level 21+
- Latest Android Build Tools

Getting started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system.

1. Download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived
  snapshot. (See the options at the top of the page.)
1. In Android Studio, use "Open an existing Android Studio project". Next select the 
  `tutorials/kotlin/MapWithMarker` directory that you downloaded
