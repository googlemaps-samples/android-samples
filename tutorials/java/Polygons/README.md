Google Maps Android API Sample: Polylines and Polygons
==========================================================

This sample goes hand in hand with a tutorial for the Google Maps Android API:
[Polylines and Polygons to Represent Routes and Areas](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/polygon-tutorial).

Prerequisites
--------------

- Android API level 21+
- Latest Android Build Tools

Getting started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system.

1. Download the samples by cloning this repository or downloading an archived
  snapshot. (See the options at the top of the page.)
1. In Android Studio, create a new project and choose the "Import non-Android Studio project" or
  "Import Project" option.
1. Select the `Polygons` directory that you downloaded with this repository.
1. If prompted for a gradle configuration, accept the default settings.
  Alternatively use the `gradlew build` command to build the project directly.

This demo app requires that you add your own Google Maps API key. See [Get an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key) for more instructions.
